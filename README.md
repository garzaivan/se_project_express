# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project demonstrates a deeper understanding of web development by integrating database management, security, testing, and deployment. It uses a structured database schema to manage collections and relationships, ensures data integrity through validation, and supports CRUD operations with proper error handling. Security is implemented via user authentication and input validation. The application is tested with unit and integration tests, including API endpoint verification, to ensure reliability and correct error responses. Deployment is configured on a remote server with process management, HTTPS, and environment-based configuration, allowing the application to run securely in production. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust server with a RESTful API, user authorization, and a production-ready setup that can be extended for complex features.
